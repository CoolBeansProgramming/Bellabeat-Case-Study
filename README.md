## Prepare 

### Data source: 

FitBit Fitness Tracker Data on [Kaggle]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) in 18 csv files. The data contains smart health data from personal fitness trackers for thirty fitbit users. The data was collected via a survey of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, hear rate, and sleep monitoring, through Amazon Mechanical Turk between March 12, 2016 and May 12, 2016. It was updated two years ago as of August 2022. The data includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate. 

### Limitations: 

* The sample size is small as only 30 individuals were considered. 

The data is about six years old; the FitBit devices have likely evolved to deliver more accurate results. 

Since the data was collected through a survey, the results may not be accurate as such participants may not provide honest and accurate answers. 

### Supporting data source: 

As the FitBit data has the limitations listed above, additional data sources will be useful in the analysis.
